    <!-- Description -->
    <p class="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
      Mr Martin Shozi, is the visionary founder of Ekhaya Smart Scholars, an organization dedicated to improving access 
      to quality education for disadvantaged learners in rural and township communities. 
    </p>

    <div id="moreText" class="hidden mt-4 space-y-3 text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      <p>      He pursued a Bachelor of Architecture (BA) degree under the Faculty of Engineering at the 
      Durban University of Technology (DUT). His journey in education has been shaped by perseverance, 
      empathy, and a deep desire to break generational barriers that hinder academic success for many young South Africans. </p>
      <p>Growing up, Mr Martin experienced first-hand the challenges faced by learners who have the potential to succeed but are held back by a lack of academic support and educational resources. These were not just his challenges, he observed the same patterns in his peers throughout primary school, high school, and even at university level. The absence of basic tools has consistently resulted in poor performance and high dropout rates.</p>
      <p>His own academic path was not without obstacles, but instead of giving up, Martin used these experiences as a catalyst for change. He realized that many learners who fail or drop out are not unintelligent, they simply lack the proper environment and support system to thrive. With this understanding, he saw an opportunity to bridge this gap and make education more accessible to learners in underserved areas.</p>
      <p>It was from this realization that Ekhaya Smart Scholars was born. The organization was founded on the belief that every learner deserves a second chance, regardless of their background. Mr Shozi established the organization to create platforms where struggling students, particularly those who failed matric or did not perform well can receive structured academic support to rewrite and pass their exams.</p>
      <p>The primary mission of Ekhaya Smart Scholars is to provide both online and physical tutoring classes that cater to the unique needs of rural learners. The hybrid model ensures that students who are far from urban centres can still access lessons virtually, while those who prefer in-person learning can attend physical sessions in nearby centres. This flexibility is one of the organization’s greatest strengths.</p>
