    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Interactive Virtual Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Our virtual classrooms go beyond traditional online learning. Students participate in real-time classes where interaction is not optional—it’s encouraged. Sessions are led by experienced instructors who facilitate live discussions, group work, and collaborative coding exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use interactive tools like breakout rooms, digital whiteboards, quizzes, and shared coding environments. This helps simulate the energy and focus of in-person classes, giving students confidence and communication skills in addition to technical knowledge.

  <!-- Campus Culture -->

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Campus Culture</h2>
    <p>
      At ESS, we believe that education is not just about academics. It’s about building community, identity, and leadership. Our virtual campus includes student-run clubs, discussion forums, competitions, mentorship circles, and cultural celebrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through initiatives like themed learning weeks, collaborative projects, and student showcases, we create an inclusive and diverse space where every learner feels seen and supported. Students are encouraged to contribute their ideas and lead activities, helping shape the learning culture itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every student at ESS is matched with learning tools and mentorship that meets their specific needs. Whether you're preparing for your first job or switching careers, our team is here to support you with structured resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes one-on-one mentorship, weekly check-ins, study groups, mental health resources, and career support. We believe that education works best when it’s human-centered and accessible, especially for students in underrepresented communities.
