    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Live Classes — Watch Anytime</h2>
    <p>
      We offer live virtual classes every week, with recordings available to watch later — perfect for students balancing work, family, or other responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our transparent and flexible model ensures you never fall behind. All classes are recorded and stored in your student dashboard for easy access, allowing you to learn on your own schedule.

  <!-- Personal Support and Mentoring -->
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">One-on-One Classes & Mentorship</h2>
    <p>
      For learners who want more individual support, we offer optional one-on-one classes tailored to your pace and needs. These sessions allow for direct engagement with tutors who specialize in your subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll also receive guidance on study techniques, exam strategy, and motivation — because we believe in building confidence, not just marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're aiming to pass or to excel, ESS will walk with you every step of the way.
